However, since I currently do not have access to your past expenses data, I recommend tracking your spending through a budgeting app or spreadsheet for better insights.\n\n### Suggested Categories to Track:\n- **Housing** (rent/mortgage, utilities)\n- **Groceries**\n- **Transportation** (fuel, public transport)\n- **Healthcare** (medications, doctor visits)\n- **Entertainment** (dining out, subscriptions)\n- **Savings/Investments**\n\n### Actionable Steps:\n1. **Review Bank Statements:** Check your bank statements for the last month to categorize your expenses.\n2. **Use Budgeting Tools:** Consider using apps like **Moneycontrol** or **Walnut** to track your spending.\n3. **Set Monthly Budgets:** Establish budgets for each category to manage your finances better.\n\nIf you have specific figures or categories in mind, please share them, and I can help you analyze them further!",
