      "content": "Here are some recent news highlights that could impact your portfolio, particularly focusing on the stocks you hold:\n\n### 1. **Hindustan Unilever Limited (HINDUNILVR)**\n- **Q1FY26 Results**: Hindustan Unilever announced a consolidated Underlying Sales Growth (USG) of **5%** for Q1FY26. This growth has led to a positive reception among brokerages, resulting in an **8% increase** in share price as they have turned bullish and raised target prices following the solid quarter performance [Source: Mint](https://www.livemint.com/market/market-stats/stocks-hindustan-unilever-share-price-nse-bse-s0003053).\n- **Market Reaction**: The stock rose approximately **3.5%** after reporting results that exceeded expectations, even though there was a slight dip in EBITDA margin due to increased costs [Source: The Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/hindustan-unilever-ltd/stocksupdate/companyid-13616.cms).\n\n### 2. **ITC Limited (ITC)**\n- ITC is also seeing significant market attention as it reported its Q1 results recently. While specific details weren't highlighted in the current news, ITC's performance can be closely tied to consumer spending trends, especially in the FMCG sector.\n\n### 3. **ICICI Bank Limited (ICICIBANK)**\n- The RBI's decision to keep the repo rate unchanged at **6.5%** may positively impact banks, including ICICI Bank, as it can help maintain interest margins. This was viewed as neutral for equity markets but could have a favorable impact on the banking sector in the long term.\n\n### Market Sentiment\n- Overall, the market sentiment is currently **neutral**, with the Nifty 50 closing at **₹24,849.91**, reflecting a **0.51%** increase. This stable market environment is generally positive for investments, but it's important to monitor sector-specific news closely.\n\n### Summary of Your Portfolio Stocks:\n| Stock | Current Value | Change (%) |\n|-------|---------------|------------|\n| Hindustan Unilever (HINDUNILVR) | ₹146,651 | +24.25% |\n| ITC Limited (ITC) | ₹136,144 | +13.80% |\n| ICICI Bank (ICICIBANK) | ₹138,546 | +16.11% |\n\nThese developments are crucial to keeping an eye on as they can impact your investment decisions and overall portfolio performance.
